## Satellite-image analyzer program

This is a Python-based image analyzer program to assess results by the color composition of images.
## Methods:
<br/>
 * Stainer - This method is based on greyscaled pixel analysis.<br/><br/>
 * Clustering - This method is based on K-means clustering.<br/><br/>

## Run:

```$ pipenv shell```

```$ pipenv install -r requirements.txt```

This is a console program, so you should focus on the command-line instructions. The program will continue only after the image-windows have been closed!
