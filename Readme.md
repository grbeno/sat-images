## Satellite-image analyzer

This is a Python-based image analysis program designed to assess results based on the color composition of images.
## Methods:
<br/>
 * Stainer - This method is based on greyscaled pixel analysis.<br/><br/>
 * Clustering - This method is based on K-means clustering.<br/><br/>

## Run:

```$ pipenv shell```

```$ pipenv install -r requirements.txt```

```$ python main.py```

This is a console program, so you should focus on the command-line instructions. The program will continue only after the image-windows have been closed!
